ResponseCleaner removes the data entry (answer) of invisible questions and defaults values

The process of cleaning data is an iterative one, as making a question invisible removes its answer, which in turn may make
other questions invisible or visible. 

To further complicate it, when a question becomes visible, it may get a default value, which may in turn trigger other visibility changes

Therefore, it's an iterative process which is also asynchronous, as condition evaluation is asynchronous.

  # Cleans data, calling back with { data: cleaned data, visibilityStructure: final visibility structure (since expensive to compute) }
  # The old visibility structure is needed as defaulting of values requires knowledge of how visibility has changed
  # The process of computing visibility, cleaning data and applying stickyData/defaultValue can trigger more changes
  # and should be repeated until the visibilityStructure is stable.
  # A simple case: Question A, B and C with B only visible if A is set and C only visible if B is set and B containing a defaultValue
  # Setting a value to A will make B visible and set to defaultValue, but C will remain invisible until the process is repeated
